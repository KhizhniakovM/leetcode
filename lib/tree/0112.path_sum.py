#
# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the
# tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the
# path equals targetSum.
#
# A leaf is a node with no children.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: true
# Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
# (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
# (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
# There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
