# Testcase Example:  '[[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]'
#
# You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1
# representsÂ land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
#
# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid
# is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one
# or more connected land cells).
#
# The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to
# the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The
# grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the
# perimeter of the island.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
# Output: 16
# Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[1]]
# Output: 4
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[1,0]]
# Output: 4
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# row == grid.length
# col == grid[i].length
# 1 <= row, col <= 100
# grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
# There is exactly one island in grid.
